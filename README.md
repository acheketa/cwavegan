# Conditional WaveGAN

In this project we developed Conditional WaveGAN to synthesize speech/audio samples that are conditioned on class labels. The thus synthesized raw audio is used for improving the baseline ASR system.

## Getting Started

Generative models are successfully used for image synthesis in the recent years. But when it comes to other modalities like audio, text, and etc, little progress has been made. Recent works focus on generating audio from a generative model in an unsupervised setting. We explore the possibility of using generative models conditioned on class labels.

## Methods

* Speech style transfer and applications in improving ASR system

Can synthesized data be used to train Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems? We tackle this problem by generating samples with large variety. We first build Conditional WaveGAN explored in this Repo to synthesize the samples that we target. Then we use the Discovery GAN architecture to perform style transfer in speech domains. The thus synthesized samples with large variety can be used to build a robust ASR system. Developing the Conditional WaveGAN is a part of this bigger project. Please refer to [this Repo](https://github.com/anooptoffy/DLJeju2018CodeRepoASR) to know more about our original ideas.

## Usage

Training can be done in both GPU and TPU settings. Only concatenation based conditioning is available in GPU, whereas bias based conditioning is also available in TPU.

### Prerequisites

* Tensorflow >= 1.4
* Python 2.7

### Datasets

1. [Speech Commands Zero through Nine (SC09)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qRdAWmjfWwfWIu-Qk7u9KQKGINC52ZwB)
2. Techsorflow Challenge [Speech Commands data full](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge/data)

Data must assume the form of `tf.Data.TFRecord`. The label data must be in one hot encoded for concatenation based conditioning, whereas it must be simple integers for bias based conditioning. Thus, the code to make the TFRecord differs by the type of conditioning.

```
python make_tfrecord.py \
	new/sc09/train \
	new/sc09_tf \
	--name train --labels \
	--ext wav \
	--fs 16000 \
	--nshards 128 \
	--slice_len 1 \
```

### Training in GPU

To begin or resume training

```
python gpu/train_wavegan.py train ./gpu/train \
	--data_dir ./data/customdataset
```

To save the checkpoints every specified minutes while training

```
# save checkpoints every 60 minutes
python gpu/backup.py ./gpu/train 60
```

To generate 20 preview audio samples with two per class

```
python gpu/train_wavegan.py preview ./gpu/preview
```

### Training in TPU

Setting up TPU is explained [here](https://medium.com/@cylee_80935/how-to-use-google-cloud-tpus-177c3a025067).

To begin or resume training

```
# concatenation based conditioning
python tpu/concat_main.py

# bias based conditioning
python tpu/bias_main.py
```

Create a bucket for backup checkpoints and name it `[CKPT_BUCKET_NAME]-backup`. To save the checkpoints every specified minutes while training

```
# save checkpoints every 60 minutes
python tpu/backup.py gs://ckpt 60
```

To generate 20 preview audio samples with two per class

```
python tpu/preview.py
```
